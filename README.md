Aria2, with integrated YAAW nd Aria2-NG Frontends
---

This is my fork of `abcminiuser/aria2-with-webui`'s docker container. I simply replaced the fronted end with YAAW, which provides more utilities than aria2-webui in my opinion.

Please refer to [abcminiuser's repository](https://github.com/abcminiuser/docker-aria2-with-webui) for instructions.

## Credits

As mentioned, this is a lightly modified version of the container by XUJINKAI/aria2-with-webui and abcminiuser/aria2-with-webui - all credits to them.
